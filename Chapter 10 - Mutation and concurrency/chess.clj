; This code INTENTIONALLY has problems with "transactionality"
; in case several threads modify the board concurrently.
; ---
; This code pulls in the parts sprayed over the book into a
; single source file, tries to make things more readable with
; better naming and "let" blocks, and adds some printing.
;
; This should be written using records, really:
;
; There is not enough structure/naming in arguments to 
; preclude confusion or lengthy cogitation of what the
; intention of the code and structures is.

; "get-king-moves" is a function taking a board cell [row col] and

; ;=> ([0 1] [1 0] [1 1])

; 1) The code in the book is hard to read; let's use "let" and name things!
; 2) This function uses "shuffle" to generate non-determinism.
;    Instead of "choose-move", let's call it "choose-move-randomly".
; 3) It is passed the (dereferenced) "to-move" ref, which is destructured:
;    [:K [2 1]] [:k [0 1]]
; 4) It returns something like [:K [2 0]]

; Updating board state
; ---
; 1) Renamed "move-piece" to "update-board", which is really what happens.
; 2) Added assert to check what's passed in.
; 3) The "place" function, passed to "alter" to modify board state to "to",
;    can be defined locally if we have a "let". Let's do that.

; "update-board" is called like this:
; (move-piece [:K [1 2]]          ; the piece move
;             [[:K [1 1]] ... ]   ; the to-move vector
; the pieces should correspond, but that is not checked...
; "move-piece" should be called "update-board", which
; is really what happens.

; If any of the assertion fail, the board is messed up due to failure in correctly
; synchronizing access by concurrent threads!
; The thread would die silently (not even a printout) after an Exception, so we need to 
; catch & print in "dothreads!"

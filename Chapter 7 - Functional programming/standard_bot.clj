; A little development on the "bot" function from "The Joy of Clojure", 2nd 
; edition, p.153. This bot has additional features to print itself and change
; the bearing. It also uses a map to find what's "left" and "right" for any 
; bearing instead of doing awkward numeric index lookups. There is also some 
; unit test code.
; ===

(def bearing-map {
    :north  { :x  0 , :y  1 , :left :west  , :right :east  }
    :east   { :x  1 , :y  0 , :left :north , :right :south }
    :south  { :x  0 , :y -1 , :left :east  , :right :west  }
    :west   { :x -1 , :y  0 , :left :south , :right :north } })

; "State" is represented by a function. This function generates a new function
; representing new state whenever the state is being stepped. 
;
; The function evidently has "inner state" (i.e. is parameterized). The inner
; state, together with parameters passed to it during state stepping flows into
; the "inner state" of the new function generated.
;
; In JoC, the function is called "bot", but this does not seems appropriate as
; it is not "thingy" like a map or a record. It should be named with a verb. 
; "mint-bot" sounds good, as we "mint" new bots (actually new "mint-bot"
; functions).

   ; Return a map holding the equivalent of:
   ; 1) OO style members/fields/attributes/properties:
   ;    These can be accessed directly in the "bot" map (But *modifying* them
   ;    means creating a new map; and in that case the modified values are
   ;    out of step with the values closed-over in the closures also stored
   ;    in the map! So don't do that!)
   ;    For fun, we mark these with ◆ (unicode 0x2526)
   ; 2) OO style methods
   ;    These close over the parameters passed to "mint-bot". This is their
   ;    sole parametrization: They cannot access anything what would be a 
   ;    "this" in OO style. 
   ;    The "state-change" functions create & return a new "bot" map by
   ;    calling "mint-bot".
